/*
Package testlog provides control over logging during tests.

Log messages written to a test case's log using t.Logf
are only printed if that particular test fails.
However, if code under test logs to a log.Logger, slog.Logger,
or the defult Loggers via functions in packages log or slog,
any test failure in the package will cause all log messages
for the package to be printed â€“ even messages from passing tests.
This is very confusing.

To avoid that, this package allows test cases
to get a Logger or override the standard logger
in a way that redirects logging output into the test log.
This way, only logs for failing tests appear in test output.

Based on code from here:
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22513
